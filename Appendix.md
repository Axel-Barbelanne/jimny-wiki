## Google Drive Documents

We moved over most of the project-related documents to the GitLab repository, but for convenience and for communication sake, there are several important documents on the SPOTS_interns/jimny/ drive folder. These include:

- **Documentation Jimny**
	This is the original documentation Google Docs. It's been around since the start of the project but is not very well organized since we also try to keep in what the past interns do, despite its relevancy.
- Plan Jimny
	This document provides an idea of the objectives we had in mind starting the project. We also added daily documentation on what we did for a while, until we accelerated our work near the end and discontinued this
- Technical documentation/Jimny_JB74_...
	Technical documentation for the Jimny, provides quite a lot of useful information
